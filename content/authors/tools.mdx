## Editor

<ul>
  <li>
    My editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a giant pile of
    [extensions](https://howivscode.com/dlarroder)
  </li>
  <li>
    I am currently using [Tokyo
    Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night) as my theme
  </li>
</ul>

## Terminal

<ul>
  <li>
    You don't need anything else when you have the [VSCode
    Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics)
  </li>
</ul>

## Desktop Apps

<ul>
  <li>
    [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is my main browser for both development and
    browsing on my laptop
  </li>
  <li>[Brave](https://brave.com/) is my secondary browser for mostly browsing on my phone</li>
  <li>
    [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for API development
    and testing
  </li>
  <li>
    [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) from VoidTools is my most favorite tool for searching
    files/folders in Windows
  </li>
  <li>
    [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) from Telerik is very useful to capture and playback
    http/https requests
  </li>
  <li>
    [Process Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) is
    very useful while working on dotnet app development
  </li>
</ul>
