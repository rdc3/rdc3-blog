I am a Full Stack Developer. I currently lead a small dev team at <b>[PHILIPS](https://philips.com/)</b>.

I have been an Automation test engineer, a Front end developer, a Backend developer & a Scrum Master at Philips.

<br />

Right after college I started my career as a Test automation engineer at <b>QuEdge Software Solutions</b>. It was a consulting firm, so I was often deployed at client locations on various Test Automation projects.
For the most part I worked at <b>GE</b> Hyderabad for the automation of the Enervista suite of applications.

<br />

After about 2 years I moved into <b>Cognizant Technology Solutions</b>. Here I worked on automation of a Banking web application for Intuit
