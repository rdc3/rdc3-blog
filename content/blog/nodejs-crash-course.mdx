# Overview

# What is [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)?

It's an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build various applications

### Here are some of the things you can build with Node.js:

- Web applications: Node.js is a popular choice for building real-time web applications and APIs.
- Command-line tools: You can write command-line tools and scripts using Node.js
- Microservices: Node.js is well-suited for building microservices, which are small, independent services that work together to form a larger application.

## V8Engine

Node.js runs on the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/the-v8-javascript-engine), the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

## Lifecycle

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm

> ```js
> const http = require('http');
> const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
>   console.log(req);
> });
> server.listen(3000);
